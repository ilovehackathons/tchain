    "body": "<h1>How to stake your ETH</h1><p>It all depends on how much you are willing to stake. You'll need 32 ETH to activate your own validator, but it is possible to stake less.</p><p>Check out the options below and go for the one that is best for you, and for the network.</p><h2>Solo home staking</h2><ul><li><em>Most impactful</em></li><li>Full control</li><li>Full rewards</li><li>Trustless</li></ul><p>Solo staking on Ethereum is the <strong>gold standard</strong> for staking. It provides full participation rewards, improves the decentralization of the network, and never requires trusting anyone else with your funds.</p><p>Those considering solo staking should have at least 32 ETH and a dedicated computer connected to the internet ~24/7. Some technical know-how is helpful, but easy-to-use tools now exist to help simplify this process.</p><h2>Staking as a service</h2><ul><li>Your 32 ETH</li><li>Your validator keys</li><li>Entrusted node operation</li></ul><p>If you don't want or don't feel comfortable dealing with hardware but still want to stake your 32 ETH, staking-as-a-service options allow you to delegate the hard part while you earn native block rewards.</p><p>These options usually walk you through creating a set of validator credentials, uploading your signing keys to them, and depositing your 32 ETH. This allows the service to validate on your behalf.</p><p>This method of staking requires a certain level of trust in the provider. To limit counter-party risk, the keys to withdrawal your ETH are usually kept in your possession.</p><h2>Pooled staking</h2><ul><li>Stake any amount</li><li>Earn rewards</li><li>Keep it simple</li><li><em>Popular</em></li></ul><p>Several pooling solutions now exist to assist users who do not have or feel comfortable staking 32 ETH.</p><p>Many of these options include what is known as 'liquid staking' which involves an ERC-20 liquidity token that represents your staked ETH.</p><p>Liquid staking enables easy and anytime exiting and makes staking as simple as a token swap. This option also allows users to hold custody of their assets in their own Ethereum wallet.</p><p>Pooled staking is not native to the Ethereum network. Third parties are building these solutions, and they carry their own risks.</p><h2>Centralized exchanges</h2><ul><li><em>Least impactful</em></li><li>Highest trust assumptions</li></ul><p>Many centralized exchanges provide staking services if you are not yet comfortable holding ETH in your own wallet. They can be a fallback to allow you to earn some yield on your ETH holdings with minimal oversight or effort.</p><p>The trade-off here is that centralized providers consolidate large pools of ETH to run large numbers of validators. This can be dangerous for the network and its users as it creates a large centralized target and point of failure, making the network more vulnerable to attack or bugs.</p><p>If you don't feel comfortable holding your own keys, that's okay. These options are here for you. In the meantime, consider checking out our wallets page, where you can get started learning how to take true ownership over your funds. When you're ready, come back and level up your staking game by trying one of the self-custody pooled staking services offered.</p>",

The size of the article text in the English Wikipedia is around <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Size_of_Wikipedia\">20 gigabytes</a> of data in 2020. It means that everytime you watch a season of the Walking Dead in HD (1080p), you have downloaded on your computer/phone the same amount of data as the entire Wikipedia encyclopaedia.</p>\n<p>Same applies to Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon and Youtube. Music is much smaller than a HD video but an average user consumes several songs in a day so at the end of the year, the impact of the climate is not negligeable.</p>\n<p>Both music and video streaming relies on servers as well as internet infrastructures to transport the data to you. All of this has a cost, so instead of streaming in all circumstances, try to listen to the radio, go the cinema.... Who knows, you might end up meeting real people in real life!</p>\n<p>Don't forget to cancel auto play by default, leading to unnecessary streaming like Youtube is doing. In most video streaming platform, you can save this behavior in the preferences. If you can, use Peertube, a decentralized and open-source video platform, much better for the environment compared to Youtube and more ethical.</p>\n<p>If you still want to use YouTube, we recommend <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-focus/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=search\">Youtube Focus</a>, an add-on who tries to promote a healthier watching. As said on their <a href=\"https://github.com/Jompa14/YouTube_Focus\">Github</a>, YouTube has one billion hours watched daily, and it‚Äôs recommendation algorithm generates more than 70% of views. That means 700.000.000 hours every single day. What means that the greatest slice of time that people spend on YouTube isn‚Äôt because they searched for something to watch or something to learn, it is because they were suggested by YouTube's algorithm.</p>\n",

They are tokens that live on a blockchain and represent ownership of unique items.</p><p><strong>Non Fungible</strong> means your asset is unique, and irreplaceable. Furthermore, you cannot exchange it for a similar asset. A good example would be your birth certificate. Even though everyone has a birth certificate, they are all different and no one can trade it. A <strong>fungible</strong> item is an item that‚Äôs not unique. An example of a fungible item is money. The $1 bill in my pocket holds the same value as your $1 bill. We can swap them.</p><p>A <strong>token</strong> is a unique digital certificate created by a smart contract and stored on a blockchain.</p><p>Before NFTs, anyone could copy and paste a piece of art or document on the web. NFTs allow users to keep ownership and they create an individual fingerprint for each item. NFTs make it so that no one can copy your asset. Each asset is 1 of 1.</p><p>The blockchain makes sure that your unique information is never tampered with. It also allows you to track who is the current owner of the token and shows how much it has sold for in the past.</p><p>NFTs give you ‚Äòdigital bragging rights‚Äô as the owner of an asset. There may be copies of your asset out there, but the blockchain will show that YOU are the true owner of the original.</p><p>Some current examples of NFT usage:</p><ul><li>Digital Artwork</li><li>Domain Names</li><li>Real Estate</li><li>In-Game items (video games)</li><li>Concert Tickets</li></ul><p>You can use NFTs for anything that is unique or limited and needs proof of ownership.
